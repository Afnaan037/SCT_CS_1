# SCT_CS_1
# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Tool

This Python project allows users to **encrypt and decrypt messages** using the classic **Caesar Cipher** algorithm. It’s a simple text-based encryption method where each letter is shifted by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypt any message with a shift key
- Decrypt encrypted messages using the same key
- Handles uppercase, lowercase, spaces, and punctuation
- Command-line based interaction

## 📌 What is Caesar Cipher?

Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest known encryption techniques, where each letter in a message is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3:
- A → D
- B → E
- ...
- Z → C
